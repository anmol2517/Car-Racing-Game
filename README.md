# Car-Racing-Game
I Developed "Car Racing Game" in "c++" -> The cursor is placed at the specified spot on the screen via the "gotoxy()" function. 
This indicates that the gotoxy() method can be used to move the pointer around the screen. 
The main purpose of it is to print text wherever the pointer is placed.
